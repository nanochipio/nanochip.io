              Did you know that many share registers are incomplete or
              contain errors?
              Building a share register with Excel or Word can easily lead to
              inconsistencies.
              Set up your shares with Ledgy
              and be sure that all data is consistent at any time.

              What’s the stake percentage of the founders after a VC
              invests $2,000,000 at a valuation of $7,500,000 taking into account
              the 2 outstanding convertible loans and increasing the ESOP pool?<br />
              Honestly, we don’t know. But Ledgy does.

              Oh, it’s tax season again and there are 50 holding confirmations
              waiting to be sent to your shareholders.
              This means pasting names into document templates,
              computing the tax value of all shares … <br />
              Don’t worry. Generate and send all important documents with a single click on Ledgy.

              You are an investor and want to track your portfolio companies?
              The founders are busy and the numbers they give you are different
              from your own records?<br />
              With their share register on Ledgy, there’s only a single source of truth.
              Convince your companies and you will never miss anything regarding your investments.
